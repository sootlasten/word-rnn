# word-rnn

An implementation of a lstm model inspired by [Zaremba et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2329) and Tensorflow's official 
[RNN tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/recurrent/). The code is developed in Python 2.7.

The motivation for creating the model is to compare the performance of my [character-level language model](https://github.com/sootlasten/char-rnn) 
to a model that models language at a world-level.
